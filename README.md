All data is pulled from HealthKit. Calories burned, both active and resting, are subtracted from calories eaten to determine the user's net energy for the day. For example, if the user burns 2300 calories naturally during the day, and also exercises to burn 300 calories, they have burned 2600 calories for the day. If they then eat 2000 calories, they have a deficit of 600 for the day.
